# Balanced Citizen

There are 24 hours in a day. Make the most of them!

With this app, you'll be able to track your productivity with an emphasis on balance in three separate categories:

1. Workin': This is work. You're putting your efforts toward a task that you have to do. Could be paid labor, could be yard work, any type of work.
2. Strivin': This category is for any sort of self-improvement work. Going to the gym. Reading. Studying a new language. Meditation.
3. Thrivin': This category is for fun. If you're at a music festival, you're thrivin'! If you're at a restaurant with your best friend, thrivin' is what you're up to.
